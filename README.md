flowexit
========

A scala app for manipulating - and removing - content from FlowDock.

Currently I just let Eclipse compile the classes and 
run this from command line like this:

~/scala/scala-2.10.3/bin/scala -cp bin flowexit.App < email > < password > < org > < flow > > urls.txt

Program status goes to STDERR and URL list goes to STDOUT.
